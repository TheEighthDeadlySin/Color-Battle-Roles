Life Transferrer- (2)
- Chooses a target to live with during the game.
- Doing so will cause all role actions targeted at the life transferrer to fail. But any role actions towards the person who they live with affect the Transferrer as well.
- Action is instant. Cannot change targets after initial pick. Picks are only done during the night. Transferring life isn't a visit.
- Respawns in 4 phases.
