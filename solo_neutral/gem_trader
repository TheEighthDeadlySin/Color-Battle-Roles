Gem Trader- SOLO
- Starts off the game with a certain number of charged gems. (Number of gems = Number of people/4 , Rounded down) 
- Can give a gem (charged or drained) to a person every night. A person with a charged gem is provided weak protection permanently. Both the charged gem and the drained gem roleblock the current holder.
- If a person with a charged gem is weak attacked, the gem turns into a drained gem.
- If a person with a charged gem is strong attacked, the gem is destroyed and removed from the game.
- If a person with a drained gem is weak attacked and killed, the drained gem is returned to the gem trader.
- Anyone with a gem can pass it to others. The person is informed if they hold a powered gem or a drained gem.
- Attempting to give a gem to anyone who already holds a gem will fail, except if it's the gem trader. If you are killed by the daily tribute while holding a gem, you will be killed and the gem will be returned to the gem trader.
- If the gem trader survives 1 full day with 0 gems, they win. Gems are given to people after attacks, so if the gem trader has no gems when a night's attacks happen, they'll win and any attempts to transfer gems that night will be cancelled.
- Anyone with a gem the night prior to the gem trader winning, will die. These deaths are counted as NIGHT KILLS and not day kills. Gem explosions are unstoppable attacks.
- Gem transfer is a post-night action. Gems are role_items.
- Cannot respawn.
